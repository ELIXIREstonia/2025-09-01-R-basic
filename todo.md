# Parking lot

Here we keep the ideas for future development based on the feedback of helpers, attendees and trainers.

### Make a markdown document for the most beginner students that includes:
- markdown document structure
- variables
- executing line of code (explain that the earlier lines of code should be executed to make sure the needed variables are defined)
- data types (string, numbers, boolean etc.)
- aritmetic operations
- if/else conditions
- iterators (for, foreach, while etc.)
- functions

## Reminders
- Make sure to note that it is possible to run the whole code snippet by clicking the green "play" button. Fixes the problem of failing executions because earlier code lines have not been run.
