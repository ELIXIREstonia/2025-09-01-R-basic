### Make a markdown document for the most beginner students that includes:
- markdown document structure
- variables
- executing line of code (explain that the earlier lines of code should be executed to make sure the needed variables are defined)

- aritmetic operations
- if/else conditions
- iterators (for, foreach, while etc.)
- functions
